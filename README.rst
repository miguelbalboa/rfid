rc522-ultralight-c
=======

RC522 with ESP32 and support for MiFare Ultralight C.

Warning
-------

This library has only been tested with ESP32. It might not work on other boards (or at least there will be adaptions to be made).

The 3DES library used to authenticate agains the Ultralight C PICC is Mbed TLS (see https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls). Setup for other platforms than ESP32 might be different. ESP-SDK comes packaged with some Mbed TLS functionality, but DES is disabled for security reasons. The easiest way to provide it is just packaging it with the repository.

Original Readme

Arduino library for MFRC522 and other RFID RC522 based modules.

Read and write different types of Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) cards
on your Arduino using a RC522 based reader connected via the Serial Peripheral
Interface (SPI) interface.

History
-------

The MFRC522 library was first created in Jan 2012 by Miguel Balboa (from
http://circuitito.com) based on code by Dr. Leong (from http://B2CQSHOP.com)
for *"Arduino RFID module Kit 13.56 Mhz with Tags SPI W and R By COOQRobot"*.

It was translated into English and rewritten/refactored in the fall of 2013
by SÃ¸ren Thing Andersen (from http://access.thing.dk).

It has been extended with functionality to alter sector 0 on Chinese UID changeable MIFARE card in Oct 2014 by Tom Clement (from http://tomclement.nl).

Maintained by miguelbalboa until 2016.
Maintained by Rotzbua from 2016 until 2018.
